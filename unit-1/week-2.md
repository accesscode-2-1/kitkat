### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

The tech field pays well. It pays especially well for people who show initiative and creativity.
Tech can be used to make meaningful changes in the world through attempting to solve issues that are important to us and many others.

It shows a very clear example of the type of change that learning to code can bring about in a person's life.

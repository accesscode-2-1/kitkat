### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?<br>
-The idea of think more positive and thinking less negative has been repeated during the think pieces, which is great since it will help us program ourselves to do so. <br>
- The need of more examples how to be more positive

* How does this think piece relate to access code? <br>
The article reminds AccessCoders to think more positive about their code and understand that if failed, they can encourage themselves to change it

### TODOs

-Get the whole pod comfortable with the bootcamp material by the assessment next week. <br>
-Have instructors be more hands on because majority of the students are not understanding the concepts of building an app through reading documentation. 

### Extra comments / Anything you want your program managers to know

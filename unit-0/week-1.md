**Joshelyn Vivas**

* Last week’s goal: Learn more about coding and IntelliJ
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I finally able to under more about Git and their commands. I learned that command prompt on a pc is the same as terminal in a mac. I also learned more coding stuff from IntelliJ
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) More practice and time to complete exercise. Due to work, school and now Access Code, I feel as if I am a computer ready to combust due to lack of processing alot of information.
* What is your goal for next week? To practice Terminal (in terms of git push) and Intelli J using the new variables.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) I think this is more of my need for time to process everything I am learning.

* This week's medium post:  https://medium.com/@HoshikoOki/git-github-cf702a6e23f1 
* Last week’s goal:Try to ask questions when I get lost.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)  I really enjoyed learning Java and I feel i have a clearer understanding of Git/GitHub thanks to Alex!
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Writing and reading in English can be a big challenge to me and takes time.  But I have to get used to it so I will take more time to write for Tweeter and Mideum and read Think Piece in the future. 
* What is your goal for next week?  Learn more about the Java and get used to using Git/GitHub
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) 

**Anthony McBride**

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@McBride_Anthony/this-is-my-story-1870f39097cc
* Last week’s goal: Become more comfortable with Git (creating repositories and updating them)
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I have definitely become more comfortable with using Git after today's proposed streamlined way of using it for future class projects. Reviewing how to initialize and commit to the remote repository really helped.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I have had the most trouble with Git and I believe I overcame some of those troubles today using the aforementioned method.
* What is your goal for next week? My goal for next week is to come up with my own way of implementing loops logically.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) I am sure that I will continue to need practice using Git. As far as materil already covered aside from Git, I feel confident in my understanding.

* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Github. I had trouble creating and linking my repository. 

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? mindset as a programmer and learn how to take criticism.
* How does this think piece relate to access code? In this tech industry, working as a team is the most crucial part. Therefore, having these optimistic mindsets will help us to become a better programmer and emotionally professional.

**Joshelyn Vivas**

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@Jvvlives2005/access-code-2-1-exploration-1-first-day-and-unit-0-ee792dcda11b
* Last week’s goal: Learn more about coding and IntelliJ
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I finally able to under more about Git and their commands. I learned that command prompt on a pc is the same as terminal in a mac. I also learned more coding stuff from IntelliJ
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) More practice and time to complete exercise. Due to work, school and now Access Code, I feel as if I am a computer ready to combust due to lack of processing alot of information.
* What is your goal for next week? To practice Terminal (in terms of git push) and Intelli J using the new variables.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) I think this is more of my need for time to process everything I am learning.

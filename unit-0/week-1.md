**Joshelyn Vivas**

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@Jvvlives2005/access-code-2-1-exploration-1-first-day-and-unit-0-ee792dcda11b
* Last week’s goal: Learn more about coding and IntelliJ
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I finally able to under more about Git and their commands. I learned that command prompt on a pc is the same as terminal in a mac. I also learned more coding stuff from IntelliJ
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) More practice and time to complete exercise. Due to work, school and now Access Code, I feel as if I am a computer ready to combust due to lack of processing alot of information.
* What is your goal for next week? To practice Terminal (in terms of git push) and Intelli J using the new variables.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) I think this is more of my need for time to process everything I am learning.

**Hoshiko Oki**

* This week's medium post:  Sorry I will do it tonight and update it with the link. 
* Last week’s goal:Try to ask questions when I get lost.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)  I really enjoyed learning Java and I feel i have a clearer understanding of Git/GitHub thanks to Alex!
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Writing and reading in English can be a big challenge to me and takes time.  But I have to get used to it so I will take more time to write for Tweeter and Mideum and read Think Piece in the future. 
* What is your goal for next week?  Learn more about the Java and get used to using Git/GitHub
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? I'm a pessimist and I need to change the way I process things.
* How does this think piece relate to access code? If I do not change the way I think I will not be an optimal programer. I will forever doubt myself.

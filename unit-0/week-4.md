* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I still struggle a bit with java documentation as I am not yet comfortable with my knowledge of all of the jargon.

* Last week’s goal: Try to understand "method" more.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I think I understand method a little more through class and homeworks.

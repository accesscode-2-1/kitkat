### Retrospective

**Ray Acevedo**

* This week's medium post:
* Last week’s goal:Complete HW, do my part of the group project.  Learn how to use files in Java.

**Joshelyn Vivas**

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@Jvvlives2005/access-code-2-1-exploration-5-signboard-project-demos-759ef855fc85
* Last week’s goal: Try to review the materials to understand how it goes
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Understood few parts...still working on it
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)   TIME as always!! Also some of the problems are confusing due to the misunderstanding of the logic. When people say write/draw it out, it does not work on me at all! 
* What is your goal for next week? Pass the Assessment on Tues!! Study my rear off to understand the loops and advanced stuff 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) It's more of the need for time to review the notes and understand the syntax and logic

* What is your goal for next week? Overcome frustration. 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can). I need more time to comprend the things we learn. But there's simpling not enough hours in a day.

* This week's medium post: (to be added at a later date)

* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I managed to complete most of my homework. I ran out of time and had to complete the rest this morning.

* What is your goal for next week? My goal for next week is to take time to review unit-0's material and really make sure that I feel more comfortable with it.

**Hoshiko Oki**

* Last week’s goal: To review all the subjects I did not do well on the test.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I wenth through the exerceises,tutorial videos and class materials and feel a little more confident about some of the subjetcs.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)  I want to go through more exercises to be ready for the next test!
* What is your goal for next week? To get the good score on the test!
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
We should act we are confident (or at least push ourselves to do something) even if we are not confident enough until we get confident.
We should keep trying instead of worrying or beign overwhelmed and give up things.  And "power" pause can work because you make an effort to pay attention to your attitude to be positive/powerful.

* How does this think piece relate to access code?
Some of us thought that we agree to the think piece but some thought it is wrong to fake.  Also some thought if they have to fake, it is hard because they can not show when they do not understand the class materials or exercises.

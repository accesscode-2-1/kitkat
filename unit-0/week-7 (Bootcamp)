### Retrospective

**Ray Acevedo**

* This week's medium post:
* Last week’s goal:Better understand objects, methods, and constructors.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)I have a better understanding of objects, methods, and constructors.
* What could have gone better? I have not done this week's HW or my part of the group project.
* What is your goal for next week? Complete HW, do my part of the group project.  Learn how to use files in Java.
* What do you need help with? HW, group project, and using files in Java.

**Joshelyn Vivas**

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@Jvvlives2005/access-code-2-1-exploration-5-signboard-project-demos-759ef855fc85
* Last week’s goal: To learn the terminology when going in java (ex: call a method, establish a variable, give an instance)
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Understood few parts
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)   TIME as always!! Also some of the problems are confusing due to the misunderstanding of the logic. When people say write/draw it out, it does not work on me at all! 
* What is your goal for next week? Dunno....try to review the materials to understand how it goes
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) It's more of the need for time to review the notes and understand the syntax and logic

**Vanice Yee**

* This week's medium post: None for this week
* Last week’s goal: Better understand programming.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I understand loops a lot better.  
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) For this week, so far so good. 
* What is your goal for next week? Getting over the nervousness over android. 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can). Practice makes prefect.

* Last week’s goal: Mastering file class
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I understand it now.

* Last week’s goal: Finish homework and project on time with very, very limited time to do so.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I managed to complete most of my homework. I ran out of time and had to complete the rest this morning.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I had an emergency situation with my aunt last week that has persisted to obstruct my ability to progress with classwork and homework.
* What is your goal for next week? My goal for next week is to take time to review unit-0's material and really make sure that I feel more comfortable with it.
* What do you need help with? Nested loop logic mostly. Also syntax for calling methods.

**Hoshiko Oki**

* This week's medium post:https://medium.com/@HoshikoOki
* Last week’s goal: Try to Learn how to call method.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) calling method becoming a little more earier than before.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)  I did not have time to go through Homework nor some of the exercised in classes.
* What is your goal for next week? Want to make more time to work on unfinished exercises or projects.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
We should act we are confident (or at least push ourselves to do something) even if we are not confident enough until we get confident.
We should keep trying instead of worrying or beign overwhelmed and give up things.  And "power" pause can work because you make an effort to pay attention to your attitude to be positive/powerful.

* How does this think piece relate to access code?
Some of us thought that we agree to the think piece but some thought it is wrong to fake.  Also some thought if they have to fake, it is hard because they can not show when they do not understand the class materials or exercises.

* This week's medium post: Grit! (I completely agree with this concept. I have experienced this first hand in previous school settings. The more I wanted to succeed, the better I did. Doing it out of necessity generally did not produce better results than with things I was interested in.)
* Last week’s goal: Find a way for me to implement loops logically. (Success!)
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I met last week's goal. I have gotten a little better at using git. I have also completed several projects that I hadn't previously.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I had a major issue with git when trying to push my completed adventure game last night. I eventually decided to create a new directory and copy my game into it so that I could push that to a newly created repo.
* What is your goal for next week? My goal for next week is to continue working through my git issues. I still need more practice.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Git!!!

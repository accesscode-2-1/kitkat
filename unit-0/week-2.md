**Student 1**

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@Jvvlives2005/access-code-2-1-exploration-2-the-struggle-of-coding-3a1c9f7ef6cc
* Last week’s goal:To practice Terminal and IntelliJ (using variables)
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Understood Git and Terminal (Oh Yeah!) Understood some of the variables in IntelliJ
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Due to many things like dealing with work and this course, plus trying to under the Roman Calculator concepts, I was having confusion. I needed more time to understand the stuff.
* What is your goal for next week? To practice with loops and statements (while, for, if, else)
* What do you need help with? It's more like the need to have more exercise to practice the loops.

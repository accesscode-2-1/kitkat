* Last week’s goal:To practice Terminal and IntelliJ (using variables)
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Understood Git and Terminal (Oh Yeah!) Understood some of the variables in IntelliJ
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Due to many things like dealing with work and this course, plus trying to under the Roman Calculator concepts, I was having confusion. I needed more time to understand the stuff.
* What is your goal for next week? To practice with loops and statements (while, for, if, else)
* What do you need help with? It's more like the need to have more exercise to practice the loops.

**Vanice Yee**

* This week's medium post: will be updated soon.
* Last week’s goal: Getting more formiliar with github.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I understand github better. Goal met yeah! But his week has been the most stressful of the year so far. 
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) There are a lot of codes I do not fully comprhend for our project. It did give me stress and hopefully I can better comprehend for this week. 
* What is your goal for next week? To fully understand what we have learned. 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) for and while  loops, and methods. 

**Anthony McBride**

* Last week’s goal: Find a way for me to implement loops logically. (Success!)
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I met last week's goal. I have gotten a little better at using git. I have also completed several projects that I hadn't previously.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I had a major issue with git when trying to push my completed adventure game last night. I eventually decided to create a new directory and copy my game into it so that I could push that to a newly created repo.
* What is your goal for next week? My goal for next week is to continue working through my git issues. I still need more practice.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Git!!!

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
..*Things to Implement (or take in mind) with Grit: A sub goal needs to be in place in order to achieve the big goal; the issue with developing grit involves the need to fill the gap between context and experience.
..*Grit needs to be learned by someone (whether in school or outside from it) and you don't need a high IQ to develop grit.

* How does this think piece relate to access code?
..*As a programmer, you will come across a negative period where failure is present and you will give up or be frustrated. This talk does discuss this issue where grit provides the motivation or positive outlook to keep going, even if the task is difficult. As future programmers, we have to come to a realization that failure will come, but you will need to get up and be grit in order to tackle the tasks!

* Last week’s goal: To understand something this week

* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)   TIME!! I need more time to work and understand the loops, functions and method.
* What is your goal for next week? To learn the terminology when going in java (ex: call a method, establish a variable, give an instance)
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) It's more of the need for time to review the notes and understand

* What is your goal for next week? Mastering file class
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)

* This week's medium post: (to be added at a later date)
* Last week’s goal: Finish homework and project on time with very, very limited time to do so.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I managed to complete most of my homework. I ran out of time and had to complete the rest this morning.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I had an emergency situation with my aunt last week that has persisted to obstruct my ability to progress with classwork and homework.
* What is your goal for next week? My goal for next week is to take time to review unit-0's material and really make sure that I feel more comfortable with it.
* What do you need help with? Nested loop logic mostly. Also syntax for calling methods.

**Hoshiko Oki**

* This week's medium post:https://medium.com/@HoshikoOki
* Last week’s goal: Try to understand "method" more.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I think I understand method a little more through class and homeworks.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)  Calling method is a little still confusing to me.
* What is your goal for next week? Learn how to call method in different occasions more comfortably.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)

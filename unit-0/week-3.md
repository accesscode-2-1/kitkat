**Student 2**

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@Jvvlives2005/access-code-2-1-exploration-week-3-how-to-import-file-in-intellij-a6fd44bcfdfd
* Last week’s goal: To practice loops and if statemenets
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Understand the structure of them like for the "for" loop, you need to give a start.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) SO MANY CHALLENGES! <br />  
* 1. Still unclear on how to use the loops </br>
* 2. Do not know when to use them or how to create it from scratch (ARGH!!!) <br /> 
* 3. There no time in my everyday to even practice or review <br /> 
* 4. Stressing on the HW!
* What is your goal for next week? To understand something this week. 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) LOOPS!! But I don't know how to word my issue.
